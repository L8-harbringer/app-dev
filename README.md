**Title:** 
Peemak

I like how it's so funny despite being a horror movie *(especially the boat scene where they escape after the charades with **Nak**)*.

> Quite a bit foolish though when they keep loving a ghost :joy_cat:

anyway, the summary is about a pregnant woman who gave birth and died with her child while her husband Mark was in a war as a listed soldier. when he went back home after the war, he was met with the fearful eyes of his neighbors whenever they heard the name of his wife, making his friends suspicious.
